# Homation

**Homation** is an NFC-based home automation solution designed to eliminate the reliance on traditional sensors, thereby enhancing both accuracy and device longevity. By utilizing NFC tags, stickers, and smartphones, Homation offers a more robust and user-friendly approach to smart home control.

## 🔧 Features

- 📱 Cross-platform mobile application
- 📡 NFC tag and sticker integration for automation triggers
- 📶 Wi-Fi connectivity using Raspberry Pi Pico W
- ⚡ Control appliances using N-channel relay modules
- 🔒 Minimal hardware wear thanks to sensor-less design

## 🚀 How It Works

Homation operates by reading NFC tags placed at various control points in your environment. Each tag is associated with a specific action configured through the mobile app. Once a tag is scanned, the system communicates with your home network to perform the desired automation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Flutter** – For building cross-platform mobile applications
- **Firebase** – For backend services and real-time updates
- **NFC** – For user-triggered automation via smartphones
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W** – For device-side logic and internet connectivity
- **N-Channel Relay** – For physical device switching

## 📦 Installation
